### Description of the Application
The purpose of the application is to find causations and correlations. It gives you the possibility to track
countless parameters and finally analyze them by having the tracked parameters displayed all together in one graph,
seeing the curves in relation to eachother. You can also hide some parameters if you do not want to see them in the graph.
You can either track numeric parameters, booleans or write texts.

The application can also be used as a simple diary.


### How can I use it?
Just go to www.yoursource.ch and sign up (or set up your own instance)...


### What is the Purpose of the Application?
I made this application as a preparation for my current job. Also, I needed a tool like that to track my own health.
